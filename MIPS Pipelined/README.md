This is a classic 5-stage MIPS Pipeline machine implementation in Verilog. This was implemented as part of my coursework at Texas A&M University. 
I intend to make several changes to the design in the following months, including branch prediction support and a simple exception handling mechanism and interrupt handling. 
The final goal is to run some straightforward software on this machine. Follow this space for updates!
