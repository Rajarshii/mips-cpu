This project was part of my ECEN-651 Course at Texas A&M University. 
This is a very simple implementation of a single-cycle MIPS instruction set. The plan is to expand the instruction set support.
Currently, the instruction set supports around 14 instructions. 
The original files used in the course lab are modified with more modern SystemVerilog Synthesizable syntax in some places.
